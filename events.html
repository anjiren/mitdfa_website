        <h1>UPCOMING EVENTS</h1>

        <div class="eventHolder">
        <div class="eventImg" style="background-image: url('img/events/arduino_hackshop.jpg');"></div> 
        <div class="eventDescription">Come make a difference with Design for America and hack an Arduino with us! From fall detectors for the elderly to pulse-sensing bracelets, design a health-related or other social impact hack idea, and we'll help you make it. We'll provide the materials, you just provide the enthusiasm to make a difference.

        No experience with Arduinos? No problem. We have MIT instructors and students on hand to teach you all about how to make something cool. Breakout sessions and Arduino 101 talks will be happening throughout the hackshop for you to learn all of the cool ways Arduinos can be used to make an impact.</div>
